# Campground Routing Optimization - Bicycle Mode with Walking Speed

## Problem Solved
Google Directions in walking mode was routing around vehicle restrictions that don't exist in campgrounds, causing unnecessary detours like the "Im Hänzel" route in Zuhause.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Routing Mode Change
- **Changed from**: Walking mode (avoids vehicle-restricted areas)
- **Changed to**: Bicycle mode (ignores vehicle restrictions, uses direct paths)
- **Result**: More direct routes within campground boundaries

### 2. Speed Recalculation
- **Google Bicycle Speed**: ~15-20 km/h (too fast for campground walking)
- **Campground Walking Speed**: 6 km/h (realistic for leisure walking with family/gear)
- **Implementation**: Distance-based time recalculation for all route steps

### 3. Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Profile mapping - use bicycle routing for direct paths
private mapProfile(profile: string): string {
  const profileMap = {
    'walking': 'bicycling', // Avoids driving restrictions
    'cycling': 'bicycling', 
    'driving': 'driving'
  };
  return profileMap[profile] || 'bicycling';
}

// Time recalculation for campground walking
const campgroundWalkingSpeed = 6; // km/h
const distanceKm = distance / 1000;
const recalculatedDurationSeconds = Math.round((distanceKm / campgroundWalkingSpeed) * 3600);
```

### 4. Benefits Achieved

#### Route Quality
- **Direct Paths**: No more detours around vehicle restrictions
- **Campground-Appropriate**: Routes suitable for pedestrian areas
- **Shorter Distances**: More efficient navigation within campsites

#### Timing Accuracy  
- **Realistic ETAs**: 6 km/h matches actual walking speed with luggage/children
- **Per-Step Timing**: Each instruction recalculated for accurate progress tracking
- **Family-Friendly**: Accounts for leisurely campground exploration pace

## Results Comparison

### Before (Walking Mode)
- Route via "Im Hänzel" detour
- Longer distance due to vehicle restriction avoidance
- Google's walking speed estimates

### After (Bicycle Routing + 6km/h Speed)
- Direct routes within campground
- Shorter, more logical paths
- Realistic timing for campground walking

## Usage Examples

### Zuhause Test Route
- **From**: Restaurant area (51.0017, 6.0510)
- **To**: Facility area (50.9982, 6.0588)
- **Expected**: Direct route, ~11 minutes at 6 km/h

### Kamperland Routes
- **Benefit**: Direct paths to beach, restaurant, facilities
- **No Detours**: Around vehicle restrictions that don't apply to pedestrians

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- **Speed Customization**: User-adjustable walking speed (4-8 km/h)
- **Route Preferences**: Scenic vs direct routing options
- **Terrain Awareness**: Adjust timing for hills/paths within campgrounds

This optimization provides professional campground navigation with realistic timing while avoiding unnecessary routing restrictions.
