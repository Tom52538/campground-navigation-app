# Deployment Guide - Google Directions Navigation App

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Sync (Manual - You Do This)
Since Replit has git protections, you'll need to sync to GitHub manually:

1. **In Replit, click the Version Control tab (left sidebar)**
2. **Click "Connect to GitHub"** if not already connected
3. **Push all changes** using the Replit Git interface
4. **Verify all files are pushed** to your GitHub repository

### 2. Railway Deployment Setup

Your app is **ready for Railway deployment** with these configurations:

#### Environment Variables Needed on Railway:
```
GOOGLE_DIRECTIONS_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

**Note**: Your Google Directions API key is already configured in Replit and will be automatically transferred to Railway deployment.

#### Railway Configuration (Already Set):
- **Build Command**: Automatic (uses package.json scripts)
- **Start Command**: `npm start` (configured in railway.toml)
- **Node.js Version**: Latest (auto-detected)

### 3. Railway Deployment Process

1. **Login to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Create New Project** â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Select your repository** (after GitHub sync)
4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - Go to project settings
   - Add the three environment variables above
5. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically build and deploy

### 4. Build Process (Automatic)
Railway will run:
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build       # Build client + server
npm start           # Start production server
```

### 5. Expected Results
- **URL**: Railway will provide a `.railway.app` domain
- **Performance**: Professional navigation with Google Directions
- **Features**: Full Kamperland routing with German instructions
