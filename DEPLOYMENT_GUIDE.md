**https://github.com/Tom52538/campground-navigation-app**

## Current Status

✅ GitHub repository created: `Tom52538/campground-navigation-app`
✅ Repository is public and ready to receive code
✅ README.md created with comprehensive documentation
✅ All application code is ready for deployment

## Manual Git Setup (Required)

Since the Replit environment has Git configuration restrictions, you'll need to complete these steps manually in the Shell:

### 1. Add Remote Origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Tom52538/campground-navigation-app.git
```

### 2. Stage All Files
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Create Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Professional campground navigation app with React-TypeScript"
```

### 4. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Download and Upload

If Git commands don't work, you can:

1. Download all project files from Replit
2. Upload them directly to the GitHub repository through the web interface
3. Or clone the empty repository locally and copy the files

## Railway Deployment Configuration

Railway deployment is pre-configured with these files:
- `railway.toml` - Deployment settings
- `build.sh` - Production build script  
- `start.sh` - Production server startup
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Auto-deployment workflow

### Deploy Steps:

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Import the `campground-navigation-app` repository
4. Railway automatically detects Node.js and runs:
   - `npm install` (dependencies)
   - `npm run build` (client build)
   - `NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts` (server start)
5. Add required environment variables
6. Deploy automatically with zero-downtime

## Environment Variables for Deployment

Make sure to set these in Railway:
```
OPENROUTE_API_KEY=your_openroute_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
NODE_ENV=production
```
