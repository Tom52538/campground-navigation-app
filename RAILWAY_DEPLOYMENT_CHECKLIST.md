# Railway Deployment Checklist & GitHub Integration Guide

## ðŸš€ Complete Deployment Workflow: Replit â†’ GitHub â†’ Railway

### Phase 1: GitHub Repository Setup

#### 1.1 Repository Preparation âœ…
- [x] Repository created: `campground-navigation-app`
- [x] Public visibility configured
- [x] Main branch established
- [x] README.md with comprehensive documentation

#### 1.2 Required Manual Steps (Complete These Now)
Since Replit has Git restrictions, complete these steps manually:

```bash
# 1. Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init

# 2. Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Tom52538/campground-navigation-app.git

# 3. Stage all files
git add .

# 4. Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Professional campground navigation app

- React-TypeScript mobile-first navigation app
- OpenRouteService integration for routing
- OpenWeatherMap weather integration  
- Multi-site support (Kamperland & Zuhause)
- Production-ready Railway deployment configuration
- Comprehensive developer documentation"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Alternative if Git commands fail:**
1. Download project files from Replit
2. Clone empty GitHub repository locally
3. Copy all files to local repository
4. Push to GitHub

### Phase 2: Railway Project Setup

#### 2.1 Railway Account & Project Creation
1. **Sign up/Login**: Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **New Project**: Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Repository Selection**: Choose `Tom52538/campground-navigation-app`
4. **Auto-Detection**: Railway detects Node.js project automatically

#### 2.2 Environment Variables Configuration
**Critical: Set these immediately after project creation**

```env
NODE_ENV=production
OPENROUTE_API_KEY=your_openroute_service_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_map_key
```

**How to get API keys:**

**OpenRouteService API Key:**
1. Visit [openrouteservice.org](https://openrouteservice.org)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Navigate to Dashboard â†’ API Keys
4. Create new API key
5. Copy key to Railway environment variables

**OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
1. Visit [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Generate new API key
5. Copy key to Railway environment variables

#### 2.3 Deployment Configuration Verification
Railway uses these pre-configured files:

**âœ… railway.toml** (Already configured)
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

**âœ… package.json scripts** (Already configured)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

---

### Phase 3: Deployment Process

#### 3.1 Automatic Build Sequence
Railway executes these commands automatically:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build client application
vite build

# 3. Bundle server code
esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist

# 4. Start production server
NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
```

#### 3.2 Production Server Configuration
The server is configured for Railway deployment:

```typescript
// server/index.ts - Production ready
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const host = '0.0.0.0'; // Railway requires 0.0.0.0 binding

app.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server running on http://${host}:${port}`);
});
```

#### 3.3 Static File Serving
```typescript
// Production static file configuration
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
  
  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
  });
}
```

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Verification

#### 4.1 Health Check Endpoints
Test these URLs after deployment:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_APP_URL with your Railway app URL
export APP_URL="https://your-app-name.railway.app"

# 1. Health check
curl $APP_URL/api/health

# 2. POI data endpoint
curl "$APP_URL/api/pois?site=kamperland"

# 3. Weather endpoint  
curl "$APP_URL/api/weather?lat=51.589795&lng=3.721826"

# 4. Frontend application
curl $APP_URL
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Deployment Issues

**Issue: Build fails with dependency errors**
```bash
# Solution: Clear Railway cache and redeploy
# In Railway dashboard: Settings â†’ Reset Build Cache
```

**Issue: Environment variables not loading**
```bash
# Solution: Verify in Railway dashboard
# Settings â†’ Variables â†’ Ensure all required vars are set
```

**Issue: API endpoints return 500 errors**
```bash
# Solution: Check API keys are valid
# Test API keys independently:
curl "https://api.openrouteservice.org/v2/directions/driving-car" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_KEY"
```

**Issue: Map not loading**
```bash
# Solution: Verify static assets are served correctly
# Check: /dist/public contains built assets
```

#### Debug Commands
```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Check build status
railway status

# Test local production build
npm run build && npm start
```
