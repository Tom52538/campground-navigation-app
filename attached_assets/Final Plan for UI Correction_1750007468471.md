Final Plan for UI Correction
1. Precise Problem Analysis (Why It Feels "Bulky")
You are right, the design feels overloaded. The reason for this is a violation of a fundamental design principle that Google Maps has perfected: Only show what is absolutely necessary for the current task.

In the current screenshot, we see two clear violations of this principle during active navigation:

Top Bar is Irrelevant: The search bar ("Einrichtungen, Resta...") and the location selector ("Zuhause") are unnecessary during an ongoing route. They take up valuable space and make the next driving instruction below them (which isn't even visible in the screenshot, but should be there) unreadable.

Lower Elements Collide: The panel with the route summary (4 min, 402m ETA 5:07 PM) and the weather widget (22°C, Wolken) are competing for the same space at the bottom of the screen. This leads to unsightly overlaps and poor readability.

2. The Final Design Solution: Two Clear States
To make the user interface state-of-the-art, we will define two exclusive states: Exploration Mode and Navigation Mode.

A. Exploration Mode (Before Starting Navigation)
This is the default state when the user opens the map to look around.

Visible:

Top: The PermanentHeader with the search bar and location selection.

Sides: The LightweightPOIButtons (left) and the EnhancedMapControls (right).

Bottom Right: The CampingWeatherWidget.

Hidden:

The TopManeuverPanel.

The BottomSummaryPanel.

B. Navigation Mode (During Active Routing)
As soon as the user taps "Navigate", the entire user interface switches to a focused state.

Visible:

Top: Only the TopManeuverPanel with the next clear driving instruction (e.g., "Towards Fasanenstraße") and a solid background for maximum readability.

Bottom: Only the BottomSummaryPanel with the route summary (remaining time, remaining distance, ETA).

Sides: The EnhancedMapControls (right). Floating buttons for mute, etc., can also be placed here.

Hidden:

The PermanentHeader (search bar). The user is not searching while driving.

The CampingWeatherWidget. The weather is relevant before the trip, but during it, the map view is more important.

The LightweightPOIButtons (POI categories). The focus is on the route, not exploration.

3. Concrete Implementation Instructions (Without Code)
To achieve this final state, the following logical changes must be made in the main component (Navigation.tsx):

Introduce a state variable isNavigating. This becomes true as soon as a route is active.

Use this variable to conditionally display components:

When isNavigating is false (Exploration Mode):

Show PermanentHeader, LightweightPOIButtons, and CampingWeatherWidget.

Hide TopManeuverPanel and BottomSummaryPanel.

When isNavigating is true (Navigation Mode):

Hide PermanentHeader, LightweightPOIButtons, and CampingWeatherWidget.

Show TopManeuverPanel and BottomSummaryPanel.

Adjust the BottomSummaryPanel: Give the panel a fixed, minimal height so that it can never collide with other elements (even if they were visible). It should be anchored discreetly at the very bottom of the screen.

Result
These changes will drastically clean up the user interface and completely resolve the issues you've pointed out. The app will feel like a professional tool that focuses on the task at hand and doesn't try to display everything at once. Readability and usability will be decisively improved as a result.
