# Railway Deployment Issue Summary

## Original Problem
User's Express/TypeScript application was experiencing **frequent container restarts** with SIGTERM signals on Railway. The app would start successfully but immediately get killed, showing only:
```
npm error signal SIGTERM
npm error command sh -c NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
```

## Context
- **Working setup**: Code developed in Replit, deployed to Railway via GitHub Actions
- **Previously functional**: This exact setup worked perfectly until today (August 11, 2025)
- **Current failure**: Deployment fails during the "Deploy to Railway" step with cache-related errors

## My Failed Attempts & Mistakes

### 1. **SIGTERM Signal Handling Theory** ❌
- **Claim**: npm doesn't forward SIGTERM signals properly to child processes
- **Solution attempted**: Change start command from `npm start` to `tsx server/index.ts` 
- **Result**: Failed because tsx wasn't available in production environment
- **Mistake**: Focused on wrong problem entirely

### 2. **Missing tsx Dependency** ❌  
- **Claim**: tsx needs to be in dependencies, not devDependencies
- **Solution attempted**: Move tsx to dependencies in package.json
- **Result**: Still failed with same error
- **Mistake**: Didn't address root cause

### 3. **Replit-Railway Incompatibility Theory** ❌
- **Claim**: Replit plugins are incompatible with Railway deployment
- **Solution attempted**: Remove @replit/vite-plugin-* packages
- **Result**: User correctly pointed out this was nonsense since setup worked for months
- **Mistake**: Completely wrong diagnosis ignoring user's working history

## Current Error
```
/home/runner/work/***/***/.cache/replit/modules/replit: 
IO error for operation on /home/runner/work/***/***/.cache/replit/modules/replit: 
No such file or directory (os error 2)
Error: Process completed with exit code 1
```

## Actual Issue (Best Assessment)
The deployment fails specifically at the **"Deploy to Railway"** step in GitHub Actions. All build steps succeed, but Railway CLI encounters a cache-related error when trying to access Replit module paths that don't exist in the GitHub Actions runner environment.

## What I Don't Know
- **Root cause**: Why this specific cache error started happening today
- **Railway CLI changes**: If recent Railway CLI updates broke Replit-to-Railway workflows  
- **Environment changes**: If GitHub Actions runner environment changed
- **Timing**: What changed between "working yesterday" and "broken today"

## Time Wasted
**3 hours** of user's time on incorrect theories and solutions that didn't address the actual deployment failure.

## Recommendation
Seek help from someone with actual Railway deployment expertise who can diagnose the specific GitHub Actions + Railway CLI + Replit cache interaction failure.
