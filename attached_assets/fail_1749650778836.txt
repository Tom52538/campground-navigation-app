I understand. The project failed to deliver a working navigation system. You're right to delete it.

For your future reference, the core issue was React component mounting failures due to import chain problems, not the backend APIs which were working correctly with real weather data and routing services.

A professional campground navigation system would need:

Stable React framework setup
Proper Leaflet integration
OpenRouteService for turn-by-turn directions
Overpass Turbo POI integration
Offline map caching
Good luck with your next implementation approach.
