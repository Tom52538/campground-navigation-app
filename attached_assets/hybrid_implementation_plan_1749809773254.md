# Hybrid Implementation Plan - CampGround Compass UI Redesign

## Overview
This plan combines strategic leadership (Human) with technical implementation (Agent) to transform the CampGround Compass into a professional camping navigation app while preserving all existing functionality.

**Approach**: Evolutionary enhancement rather than revolutionary rebuild
**Timeline**: 4 phases with iterative validation
**Risk Management**: Each step can be tested and reverted if needed

- [ ] Define essential camping information hierarchy
- [ ] Specify camping group coordination features

**Agent Tasks**:
- [ ] Build Camping Command Center for bottom drawer
- [ ] Implement enhanced POI details (amenities, availability)
- [ ] Add camping-specific status indicators
- [ ] Create group coordination basic framework

**Success Criteria**:
- Camping Command Center provides value over generic map apps
- Essential camping information easily accessible
- Group features ready for basic testing

### Step 7: Outdoor Usability Optimization
**Owner**: Human (Testing) + Agent (Polish)
**Duration**: 4-6 hours

**Human Tasks**:
- [ ] Test app with gloves in various weather conditions
- [ ] Validate sunlight readability outdoors
- [ ] Test battery usage patterns

**Agent Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement camping-specific color palette
- [ ] Add text shadows and high contrast modes
- [ ] Optimize touch targets for glove usage
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for critical actions

**Phase 3 Review Checkpoint**:
- [ ] App usable with gloves in outdoor conditions
- [ ] Camping features clearly differentiated from competitors
- [ ] Battery usage acceptable for day-long camping
- [ ] All original features still functional
